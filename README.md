## ICIC7

### ICRC-7

ICRC-7 is the minimal standard for the implementation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Internet Computer.

A token ledger implementation following this standard hosts an NFT collection (collection), which is a set of NFTs.

ICRC-7 does not handle approval-related operations such as approve and transfer_from itself. Those operations are specified by ICRC-37 which extends ICRC-7 with approval semantics.
